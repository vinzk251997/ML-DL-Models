and it means something special to me  
look at the way that she smiles when she sees me  
how lucky can one fellow be

who could ever believe that she could be mine  
shes just my kind of girl without her im blue  
and if she ever leaves me what could i do what could i do  
  
and when we go for a walk in the park  
and she holds me and squeezes my hand  
well go on walking for hours and talking  
about all the things that we plan  
  
shes just my kind of girl she makes me feel fine  
who could ever believe that she could be mine  
shes just my kind of girl without her im blue  
and if she ever leaves me what could i do what could i do

now we must suffer and sell our secrets  
bargain playing smart aching in our hearts  
  
sorry cassandra i misunderstood  
now the last day is dawning  
some of us wanted but none of us would  
listen to words of warning  
but on the darkest of nights  
nobody knew how to fight  
and we were caught in our sleep  
sorry cassandra i didnt believe  
you really had the power  
i only saw it as dreams you would weave  
until the final hour  
  
so in the morning your ship will be sailing  
now that your father and sister are gone  
there is no reason for you to linger  
youre grieving deeply but still moving on  
  
you know the future is casting a shadow  
no one else sees it but you know your fate  
packing your bags being slow and thorough  
knowing though youre late that ship is sure to wait  
  
sorry cassandra i misunderstood  
now the last day is dawning  
some of us wanted but none of us would

sorry cassandra i didnt believe  
you really had the power  
i only saw it as dreams you would weave  
until the final hour  
  
i watched the ship leaving harbor at sunrise  
sails almost slack in the cool morning rain  
she stood on deck just a tiny figure  
rigid and restrained blue eyes filled with pain

while you travel through the milky way  
from afar  
twinkle twinkle twinkle little star

silently the haze drifts through the trees  
slowly dawn is breaking through

curtins rustling in the breeze

daylight makes its way into my mind  
coming through  
yet another morning without you  
  
finally when darkness falls  
casting shadows on the walls  
in the twilight hour i am alone  
sitting near the fireplace  
dying embers warm my face  
in this peaceful solitude  
all the outside world subdued  
everything comes backs to me again  
in the gloom  
like an angel passing through my room  
  
mmm mmm mmm echoes of a voice i knew  
  
half awake in half in dreams  
seeing long forgotten scenes  
so the present runs into the past  
now and then become entwined  
playing games within my mind  
like the embers as they die  
love was one prolonged goodbye  
and it all comes back to me tonight  
in the gloom  
like an angel passing through my room  
  
i close my eyes  
and my twilight images go by  
all too soon

casting shadows on the walls

no poet has ever painted  
voices call out to me straight to my heart  
so strange yet were so well acquainted  
i let the music speak with no restrains  
i let my feelings take over  
carry my soul away into the world  
where beauty meets the darkness of the day  
  
where my mind is like an open window  
where the high and healing winds blow  
from my shallow sleep the sounds awake me  
i let them take me  
  
let it be a joke let it be a smile  
let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while  
let it be a tear let it be a sigh  
coming from a heart speaking to a heart let it be a cry  
  
some streets are emptiness dry leaves of autumn  
rustling down an old alley  
and in the dead of night i find myself a blind man  
in some ancient valley  
i let the music speak leading me gently  
urging me like a lover  
leading me all the way into a place  
where beauty will defeat the darkest day  
  
where im one with every grand illusion  
no disturbance no intrusion  
where i let the wistful sounds seduce me  
i let them use me  
  
let it be a joke let it be a smile  
let it be a farce if it makes me laugh for a little while  
let it be a tear let it be a sigh  
coming from a heart speaking to a heart let it be a cry  
  
let it be a tear let it be a sigh  
coming from a heart speaking to a heart let it be a cry  
  
let it be the joy of each new sunrise  
or the moment when a day dies  
i surrender without reservation  
no explanation no questions why  
i take it to me and let it flow through me  
yes i let the music speak

we took the chance  
like we were dancing our last dance  
  
i can still recall our last summer  
i still see it all  
in the tourist jam round the notre dame  
our last summer  
walking hand in hand

our last summer  
morning croissants  
living for the day worries far away  
our last summer  
we could laugh and play  
  
and now youre working in a bank  
the family man the football fan  
and your name is harry  
how dull it seems  
are you the hero of my dreams  
  
i can still recall our last summer  
i still see it all  
walks along the seine laughing in the rain  
our last summer  
memories that remain  
i can still recall our last summer  
i still see it all  
in the tourist jam round the notre dame  
our last summer  
walking hand in hand

my train im certain left the station just when it was due

i must have made my desk around a quarter after nine  
with letters to be read and heaps of papers waiting to be signed  
i must have gone to lunch at half past twelve or so  
the usual place the usual bunch  
and still on top of this im pretty sure it must have rained  
the day before you came  
  
i must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two  
and at the time i never even noticed i was blue  
i must have kept on dragging through the business of the day  
without really knowing anything i hid a part of me away  
at five i must have left theres no exception to the rule  
a matter of routine ive done it ever since i finished school  
the train back home again  
undoubtedly i must have read the evening paper then  
oh yes im sure my life was well within its usual frame  
the day before you came  
  
i must have opened my front door at eight oclock or so  
and stopped along the way to buy some chinese food to go  
im sure i had my dinner watching something on tv  
theres not i think a single episode of dallas that i didnt see  
i must have gone to bed around a quarter after ten  
i need a lot of sleep and so i like to be in bed by then  
i must have read a while  
the latest one by marilyn french or something in that style  
its funny but i had no sense of living without aim  
the day before you came  
  
and turning out the light  
i must have yawned and cuddled up for yet another night  
and rattling on the roof i must have heard the sound of rain

slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex

how you rise shake your head get up and ask for more  
clearheaded and openeyed  
with nothing left untried  
standing calmly at the crossroadsno desire to run  
theres no hurry any more when all is said and done

i saw you glimmer  
the desire for you made me blind

when the moons at its height  
i came to get to know you  
a disclosure so bright  
i knew in my heart  
when your flair made me swoon  
i am just a prisoner  
in search of my tune

stunk from things that used to live there  
ahhh that wasnt the city i remembered  
  
a child in the street barefoot pullin at his  
mamas tattered coattails like a rat dogs existence  
with not a scrap left on the plate

cause the only thing left was their faith  
and there sure as hell aint much i can do  
about it

theres a new day comin and i dont know why  
theres a fear that gets me high  
and the cold night numbs as the jet black clouds roll on by  
  
so sad was the scene that my eyes did behold  
made me wonder just who was the foe  
and was it all to come true what nostradamus  
had predicted such a long long time ago  
you could hear screams and moanin  
from the people atoning  
for their sins of a guilt ridden life  
and the final door shuts  
from the wind that leaves cuts  
from the edge on the blade of gods knife  
and there sure as hell aint much i can do about  
  
theres a melt down in the sky  
theres a new day comin and i dont know why  
theres a tear stuck in my eye  
theres a new day comin and i dont know why

mother nature how she cried  
by her side till the dawn  
couldnt kill her if they tried  
how they tried open eyed genocide

235,Air Supply,A Little Bit More,/a/air+supply/a+little+bit+more_21058162.html,"for certain she was the face of springtime  
the flowers stood and paid their due  
and all the folk they sang of a good rhyme  
while drinking all they wanted to  
a bitter sweet this final evening  
before he must leave her side  
  
they danced around the glass filled tables  
while fiddlers played so sweet and low  
their eyes hard fixed upon each other  
however would she let him go  
and when the time it came upon them  
she said in case we forget  
  
just a little bit more just a little bit more  
just a little bit more just a little bit more  
just a little bit more just a little bit more  
just a little bit more just a little bit more  
  
the letters came and every single sunday  
we all would wait to hear the news  
she knew her love would be home someday  
the only thing she held on to  
we sang a song just like we used to  
and she said before we could leave  
  
just a little bit more just a little bit more  
just a little bit more just a little bit more  
just a little bit more just a little bit more  
just a little bit more just a little bit more  
  
that night she heard her true love calling  
with words that only she could know  
they held each other till the morning  
and when it was his time to go  
she said  
  
just a little bit more just a little bit more  
just a little bit more just a little bit more  
just a little bit more just a little bit more  
just a little bit more just a little bit more
